# MyScraper

### Welcome to my website, which scrapes articles from chess.com and adds notes to them.
### This is useful if you're just wanting to look at specific articles and their notes
### This also can be applied to other websites, which can help others do their own scrapes to websites of their choice.
### I manitain the site so contact benzed3@gmail.com for any questions.


###### at this point, as of May 29, 2019, I have yet to add the features to include notes. This would include routes and code...
###### which will add the notes to that route, and delete them in need be.
